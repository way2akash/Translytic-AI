# Translytic AI

Translytic AI is a Chrome extension designed to enhance the YouTube viewing experience by providing real-time transcript translations, multilingual captions, summarized points, and text-to-speech (TTS) for a seamless and accessible viewing experience. The extension uses Google's AI APIs and integrates with YouTube videos to offer these features.

## Features

### 1. **Live Transcript Translation**
Translytic AI fetches YouTube video transcripts and translates them into multiple languages in real-time. Users can select their preferred language from a dropdown menu, making the content accessible to a global audience.

### 2. **Multilingual Captions**
The extension overlays translated captions directly on YouTube videos. This feature helps users follow along with the video in their native language.

### 3. **Summarization**
The extension summarizes the transcript of the video, condensing lengthy dialogues into concise points. This allows users to quickly grasp the main ideas of the video without having to watch it entirely.

### 4. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**
Translytic AI integrates TTS functionality to read aloud the translated text. This feature enhances accessibility, enabling users to consume content without needing to read captions manually.

### 5. **Language Selection**
The language selection feature allows users to choose the language they prefer for captions and TTS, making it easier to understand content in multiple languages.

### 6. **Interactive Summarization**
Translytic AI offers a unique feature where users can ask questions about the video's summarized content. The system responds with context-based answers, creating an interactive chat-like experience.

### 7. **OCR for Images (Planned)**
A future feature will allow users to upload images and extract text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The extracted text will then be translated or summarized, extending the functionality beyond just video content.

## Built With

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
